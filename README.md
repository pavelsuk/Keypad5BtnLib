Keypad5BtnLib
=============

It's a library for [5 buttons ADKeyboard from YwRobot](http://www.buychina.com/items/ywrobot-studio-arduino-electronic-building-blocks-ad-keyboard-analog-keyboards-modules-sppvmpsooko). Example uses MicroView to show the value of the input, since I plan to use it in my next projects.
